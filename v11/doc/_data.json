When the fail terminal of the HTTPInput node is triggered, a ResetContentDescriptor node is used to re-parse the input message as a BLOB (Binary Large OBject). The scenario demonstrates the ResetContentDescriptor node's ability to associate a new parser with the input message bitstream. This can be helpful in scenarios like the one demonstrated, when input data does not conform to the expected model and so down a fail / catch branch it can be reassociated with a less stringent data model and then used to generate a helpful error message for the consumer of the flow. Note that contrary to some popular misconceptions, the ResetContentDescriptor node does not change the message content, nor does it actually convert the message from one format to another."
